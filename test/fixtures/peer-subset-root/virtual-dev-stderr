Your “engines” field allows more node versions than your dependency graph does.

Conflicting dependencies: hosted-git-info, lru-cache, npm-package-arg, semver

If you want to narrow your support, you can run `ls-engines --save`, or manually add the following to your `package.json`:
"engines": {
  "node": ">= 10"
}
