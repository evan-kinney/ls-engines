Your “engines” field allows more node versions than your dependency graph does.

Conflicting dependencies: npm-package-arg, hosted-git-info, semver, lru-cache

If you want to narrow your support, you can run `ls-engines --save`, or manually add the following to your `package.json`:
"engines": {
  "node": "^17 || ^16 || ^15 || ^14 || ^13 || ^12 || ^11 || ^10"
}
